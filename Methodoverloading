Method Overloading in Java
Different ways to overload the method
By changing the no. of arguments
By changing the datatype
Why method overloading is not possible by changing the return type
Can we overload the main method
method overloading with Type Promotion
If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.

If we have to perform only one operation, having same name of the methods increases the readability of the program.

Suppose you have to perform addition of the given numbers but there can be any number of arguments, if you write the method such as a(int,int) for two parameters, and b(int,int,int) for three parameters then it may be difficult for you as well as other programmers to understand the behavior of the method because its name differs.

So, we perform method overloading to figure out the program quickly.

java method overloading
Advantage of method overloading
Method overloading increases the readability of the program.

Different ways to overload the method
There are two ways to overload the method in java

By changing number of arguments
By changing the data type
In java, Method Overloading is not possible by changing the return type of the method only.*/
